<p>This application draws the solution graph of Boolean formulas
and relations (up to 6 variables), highlighted on an orthographic hypercube projection.</p>
  <p>
&bull; A formula can be entered in the first text-box (syntax see below); <br>
&bull; A relation can be entered as list of vectors (separated by
spaces or commas, e.g.<span class="auto-style1"> 000 001 1100</span>) in the second text-box, or as
list of the vectors not in the relation in the third one.</p>
  <p>
&bull; When hitting the return key in any text-box, the solution graph is
drawn,  the clone and co-clone are calculated (up to 4 variables), 
important properties are displayed, and the
other text-boxes are updated (the formula is shown in a simplified CNF). <br>
&bull; Vectors can be added to or removed from the relation by
clicking the vertices in the graph. <br>
&bull; The window can be resized for a larger graph.<br>
&bull; The graphics can be exported as SVG-file, which can be edited
and converted to other formats with programs like Inkscape.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Formula Syntax:</span><br>
Variables can be any single digits or letters (excluding A and E);<br>upper- and lower case is distinguished.</p>
  <p>As operator are recognized:<br>&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> &amp;&amp; </span>or<span class="auto-style1"> &amp; </span>for "and",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> ||</span>,<span class="auto-style1"> |</span>, or<span class="auto-style1"> / </span>for "or",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> ! </span>or<span class="auto-style1"> - </span>for "not",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> + </span>for "xor",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> = </span>for "equals",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> A </span>for "for all",<br>
&bull;<span class="auto-style1"> E </span>for "exists".<br>
  </p>
<p>For example, &forall;x&exist;y (x&or;y&or;&not;z)&and;(&not;x&or;z) could be written as<span class="auto-style1"><br>AxEy
(x|y|-z)&amp;(-x|z)</span>.<br>
For CNF-formulas, a more compact notation can be used: the
literals of clauses are concatenated, clauses are separated by a
spaces, e.g., <br>
(x&or;y&or;&not;z)&and;(&not;x&or;z) could be written as<span class="auto-style1"> xy-z -xz</span>.</p>
